# ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Tracker

The **Student Grade Tracker** is a simple Java-based console application designed to help students, teachers, or institutions keep track of academic performance across multiple subjects or assignments. It enables users to input multiple grades for each student and provides useful analytical insights like average, highest, and lowest grades.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Project Concept

This project focuses on building a **basic yet effective academic performance management system**. It aims to:

- **Record student grades**: Users can input the name of a student along with any number of grades.
- **Ensure data accuracy**: Grades are validated to ensure they fall within the 0â€“100 range.
- **Analyze performance**: The application calculates and displays the average, highest, and lowest scores for each student.
- **Encourage structured data input** through an interactive menu-driven interface.

This tool mimics a **lightweight gradebook**, and is especially useful for:

- Practicing basic Java programming constructs such as:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Arrays
  - Loops and conditionals
  - User input handling with `Scanner`
  - Menu-driven design
- Understanding the fundamentals of data validation and basic statistics
